Welcome! I am Amelie.\
I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Teaching Assistant at the Department of\
Political Science at Trinity College Dublin.\
\
I received a B.A. in Political Science and English Studies from the\
University of Mannheim and a M.Sc. in International Politics from\
Trinity College Dublin.

I specialize in conflict research and my research interests are\
explaining sexual violence in armed conflicts and insurgent behaviour.\
With my work I seek to explain and predict socialisation patterns by\
insurgent groups in connection to conflict-related sexual violence.

I am working on my thesis: ***"Explaining variation in sexual violence in civil war: Understanding patterns of combatant socialisation"***

I am conducting the **“*Socialisation & Political Education in Rebel Groups***” (SPERG) project.\
The SPERG Project dataset measures how rebel groups utilize political education to facilitate socialization among their members in more than 240 rebel organizations. You can reach the project under: sperg_project@tcd.ie

Besides my work, I am passionate about books, pets, plants, and knitting.
