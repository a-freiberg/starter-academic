<!--StartFragment-->

Welcome! I am Amelie.\
I am a Ph.D. Student and Teaching Assistant at the Department of\
Political Science at Trinity College Dublin.\
\
I received a B.A. in Political Science and English Studies from the\
University of Mannheim and a M.Sc. in International Politics from\
Trinity College Dublin.

I specialize in conflict research and my research interests are\
explaining sexual violence in armed conflicts and insurgent behaviour.\
With my work I seek to explain and predict socialisation patterns by\
insurgent groups in connection to conflict-related sexual violence.

I am working on my thesis: ***"Explaining variation in sexual violence in civil war: Understanding patterns of combatant socialisation"***

Besides my work, I am passionate about pets, plants, and knitting.
