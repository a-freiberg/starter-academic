Welcome! I am Amelie.\
I am a Ph.D. Candidate and Teaching Assistant at the Department of\
Political Science at Trinity College Dublin.\
\
I received a B.A. in Political Science and English Studies from the\
University of Mannheim and a M.Sc. in International Politics from\
Trinity College Dublin.

I specialize in conflict research and my research interests are\
explaining sexual violence in armed conflicts and insurgent behaviour.\
With my work I seek to explain and predict socialisation patterns by\
insurgent groups in connection to conflict-related sexual violence.

I am working on my thesis: ***"Explaining variation in sexual violence in civil war: Understanding patterns of combatant socialisation"***

I am conducting the **“*Socialisation and Political Education in Rebel Groups***” (SOPERG) data project.\
The SOPERG Project dataset measures how rebel groups utilize political education to facilitate socialization among their members. You can reach the project under: freibera@tcd.ie

I will present this project at the Jan Tinbergen European Peace Science Conference (June 26th - 28th, 2023) in Bologna.

Interested in my research? Check out the episode of the CRSV Podcast. Where I talk about my research on Conflict-related sexual violence and combatant socialization\
You can find it here: <https://www.crsvobservatory.com/podcast/episode/55949ad6/episode-19-amelie-freiberg>

Besides my work, I am passionate about books, pets, plants, and knitting.
